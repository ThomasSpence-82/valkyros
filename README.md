# Valkyros Engine

**Valkyros Engine** is a AAA-grade, cross-platform 3D game engine built with modern C++ emphasizing modularity, performance, and maintainability.

Currently supporting Windows and Linux platforms, Valkyros provides core systems including rendering, input, memory management, and GUI abstraction. The engine aims for clean, extensible architecture with robust tooling and documentation to enable efficient game development at scale.

The rendering backend starts with OpenGL, with plans to transition to Vulkan for advanced graphics features.

This project follows strict coding standards and integrates continuous integration workflows to ensure high code quality.
