# Valkyros Engine Style Guide

This document outlines the coding conventions and style rules followed in the Valkyros engine to maintain clarity, consistency, and professionalism.

## General Principles

- Use **modern C++17/20** features where appropriate.
- Prefer **constexpr**, **auto**, and **smart pointers** (unique_ptr, shared_ptr).
- Follow **RAII** for resource management.
- Use **namespaces** to avoid symbol collisions, e.g., `valkyros::core`.

## Naming Conventions

- Files and folders: lowercase with underscores (`engine_core.h`, `sandbox_app.cpp`)
- Classes and structs: PascalCase (`RenderEngine`, `InputManager`)
- Functions and variables: camelCase (`initializeEngine()`, `frameCount`)
- Constants: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (`MAX_FRAME_RATE`)

## Formatting

- Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs
- Line length: 120 characters max
- Braces: K&R style (opening brace on the same line)
- Comment style: use Doxygen style for API documentation
- Use `//` for short comments, `/* ... */` for longer explanations

## Documentation

- Every public API must have Doxygen comments.
- Use meaningful commit messages, referencing issue IDs where possible.

Additions and refinements will be made as the project evolves.
