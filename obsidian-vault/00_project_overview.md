# Valkyros Engine Project Overview

## Vision

Valkyros is an ambitious, AAA-grade, cross-platform 3D game engine built from the ground up with modern C++ and Vulkan. Inspired by industry-leading engines like Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot, Valkyros aims to provide a highly modular, extensible, and performant platform for creating cutting-edge games and real-time applications.

## Goals

- **AAA Quality & Performance:** Develop a production-ready engine capable of powering commercial AAA titles, emphasizing efficiency, stability, and scalability.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Target Windows initially, with plans to support Linux, macOS, and modern consoles.
- **Modular Architecture:** Maintain clear separation of subsystems (rendering, input, audio, physics, GUI, etc.) for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- **Modern APIs:** Use Vulkan as the primary graphics API for high performance and low-level control.
- **Custom Tools:** Provide integrated tooling and editors to streamline game development workflows.
- **Open and Documented:** Fully documented with professional-grade code comments, design docs, and user guides, maintained using Obsidian and MkDocs.

## Project Scope

- **Core Engine:** Rendering, resource management, scene graph, event system, math libraries.
- **Subsystems:** Input handling, audio, physics integration, scripting interfaces.
- **Editor:** Initial focus on a lightweight sandbox app; long-term goal to develop a full-featured WPF-based editor.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive developer documentation maintained in Obsidian, published via MkDocs.
- **Version Control & CI:** Managed via GitHub with continuous integration pipelines for build verification.

## Milestones (High-Level)

1. **Project Setup & Initial Commit:** Repository structure, basic engine scaffolding, build system.
2. **Window & Rendering Setup:** Cross-platform window management with GLFW, Vulkan renderer integration.
3. **Subsystem Foundations:** Input, audio, and core math utilities.
4. **Sandbox Application:** Minimal executable to test engine components.
5. **Editor Prototype:** WPF-based editor shell integrating with engine libraries.
6. **Feature Expansion:** Advanced rendering techniques, physics, networking, GUI.
7. **Documentation & Tutorials:** Continuous updates synced between Obsidian and MkDocs.
8. **Alpha & Beta Releases:** Internal tests leading to public demos.

## Development Philosophy

- Incremental, test-driven development focused on clean, maintainable code.
- Open design discussions and documentation to guide decision making.
- Emphasize tooling and workflows that support developer productivity.
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-managed to ensure portability and stability.
