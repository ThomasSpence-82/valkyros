# Vulkan Renderer Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation details for the Valkyros Engine's Vulkan renderer, designed to provide high-performance, low-level graphics control while maintaining a clean abstraction layer.

## Core Components

### 1. Vulkan Instance and Device
- **Instance Creation**
  - Enable validation layers in debug builds
  - Support for required extensions
  - Application/engine versioning
- **Physical Device Selection**
  - Score-based GPU selection
  - Support for discrete and integrated GPUs
  - Feature detection and capability reporting

### 2. Memory Management
- **Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) Integration**
  - Efficient GPU memory allocation
  - Memory pooling and defragmentation
  - Dedicated allocation for large resources

### 3. Swapchain and Presentation
- **Window Surface**
  - GLFW surface creation
  - Surface capabilities and format selection
- **Swapchain Management**
  - Triple buffering support
  - VSync and present modes
  - Resize handling

### 4. Rendering Pipeline
- **Pipeline State Objects (PSO)**
  - Shader module management
  - Pipeline caching
  - Dynamic state management
- **Descriptor Sets**
  - Global and material descriptor sets
  - Dynamic uniform buffers
  - Texture and sampler management

## Implementation Details

### Shader System
- **SPIR-V Compilation**
  - Runtime shader compilation from GLSL
  - Shader reflection for pipeline layout creation
  - Hot-reloading support

### Resource Management
- **Texture System**
  - Support for various formats (PNG, JPG, HDR, KTX)
  - Mipmap generation
  - Texture arrays and atlases
- **Buffer Management**
  - Staging buffers for uploads
  - Device-local memory for performance
  - Buffer pooling

### Synchronization
- **Frame Synchronization**
  - Fences and semaphores
  - Multiple frame in-flight
  - Resource barriers and layout transitions

## Integration Points

### With Core Engine
- Abstract renderer interface
- Resource loading system
- Window management

### With Editor
- Debug visualization
- GPU profiling
- Shader hot-reloading UI

## Performance Considerations
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation
- Memory aliasing for transient resources
- Pipeline barriers and synchronization overhead

## Future Extensions
- Ray tracing support
- Mesh shaders
- Variable rate shading
